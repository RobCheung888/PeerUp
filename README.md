## Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people’s mental health and created new barriers for people already with mental illness and substance use disorders. 

According to kff.org, about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have reported anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms during the pandemic. This share has been broadly consistent, up from one in ten adults who reported these symptoms from January to June 2019

So, we have decided to make a safe platform to support people with mental illnesses and give people the tool to be able to talk to someone anonymously. 


## What it does
PeerUp allows people to volunteer to give support to the others with mental illnesses or having a bad mood during the desperate times of covid by chatting. Since we want our platform to be safe, we have strict rules on volunteer registration. In order to prevent people with bad intentions from using the website, volunteers have to be interviewed before chatting with people who need help. 

## How we built it
For the website, we used figma to build a blueprint of the website in the first place. After having an idea on the content of the website, we started to make the website in VS Code with HTML and CSS. And we have implemented an api from crisp.chat for the online chatting system, so that the volunteer can chat with people who need help. At this moment, we will interview and select volunteers by ourself.

## Challenges we ran into
We were not skillful enough to make a login system which requires knowledge in mySQL, php and node,js

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Build a website with CSS and HTML
2. Implemented an API into the website
3. Able to help with people with mental illness 
4. Become friends with each other!!
